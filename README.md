# UIColor_WatchKitColors
UIColor extension to provide the colors specified in the Apple Watch Design Guides at https://developer.apple.com/watch/human-interface-guidelines/resources/

Note that the extension is Swift but it can be used just fine in Objective-C code. The sample app is written in in Objective-C.
